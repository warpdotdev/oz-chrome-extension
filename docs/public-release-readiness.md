# Public release readiness plan

The repository starts private. Before publishing:

1. Choose and add a license.
2. Separate any internal-only endpoints, secrets, or assumptions.
3. Add threat model and security checklist for generated script ingestion.
4. Add contributor docs and issue templates.
5. Add sample data and examples safe for public distribution.
6. Finalize support and disclosure policy.
